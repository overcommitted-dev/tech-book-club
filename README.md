# Overcommitted Tech Book Club

Welcome to the Overcommitted Tech Book Club! This is an asynchronous book club associated with the Overcommitted podcast, where we explore books that make us better developers, teammates, and technical leaders.

## Current Book: "Looks Good To Me" by Adrienne Braganza Hendricks

Our inaugural book explores the critical but often overlooked world of code review culture. Through research, interviews, and practical insights, this book examines how we can transform code reviews from a source of friction into a powerful tool for learning, collaboration, and team building.

### How It Works
